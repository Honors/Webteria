#Webteria
Webteria fits a given node-graph to a per-node set of critera; more 
concretely, given required connection counts for each of a graph's nodes, 
Webteria will determine a means of interconnecting all nodes.

##Uses
Although this algorithm may sound esoteric, it proves useful in Chemistry, 
and any other setting of massively mutual interaction. The algorithm, although 
not in this form, has been used a Chemistry tool hosted at 
[bonds.io](http://bonds.io) and available on the iOS App Store.

Other uses could hence be peer-to-peer networking or distributed computing, as
well as others which have yet to be noted.
